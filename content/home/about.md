# Biography

I am an assistant professor in the [Central Diagnostics Laboratory](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Subsites/UMC-Utrecht-Lab/About-us/Laboratory-of-Clinical-Chemistry-Haematology) which is part of the [Circulatory Health Program](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Research/Strategic-themes/Circulatory-Health) at the University Medical Center Utrecht and University of Utrecht and work with [professor dr. Folkert W. Asselbergs](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/Research/Strategic-themes/Circulatory-Health/Research-themes/Group-Asselbergs) and [professor dr. Gerard Pasterkamp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-pasterkamp-71a1b36/). My research interest is focused on the genetic and epigenetic causes of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis underlying _ischemic stroke (IS)_ and _coronary artery disease (CAD)_, and their intermediate traits such as _carotid intima media thickness (cIMT)_ and _arterial calcification_. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci robustly associated to these diseases and traits. With my work I ultimately aim to move from GWAS loci to novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases through extensive _in silico_, and _in vitro_ modeling.

As a means to this end, I am currently working on integrating Bayesian fine-mapping methodology, co-localization, causal inference through Mendelian Randomization, expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses, GWAS, single-cell RNA sequencing, and plaque characterization based on high-throughput imaging of histological slides and machine learning algorithms. This has resulted in the identification of 28 loci with a substrate in plaques that harbor genes potentially causal to atherosclerosis and amenable to therapy. We are currently pursuing several targets _in vitro_.

My vision is that this holistic approach will identify the truly viable targets to feed the drug developmental pipeline to combat the cardiovascular disease epidemic. This approach is entirely human-centered and does not involved new _in vivo_ experiments.

I actively contribute to the [International Stroke Genetics Consortium](http://www.strokegenetics.org). In addition, I make contributions to international consortia, including [GENIUS-CHD](http://www.genius-chd.com), [GIANT](http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium), [GLGC](http://lipidgenetics.org), [GoDMC](http://www.godmc.org.uk), and various other international consortia. 

I am a Review Editor for Frontiers in Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Prevention and Frontiers in Human Genomics.

This work is covered through various (inter)national collaborative grant programs: CVON-GENIUS2 funded by the Dutch Heart Foundation (DHF, grant-number: CVON 2017-20), ERA-CVD 'druggable-MI-targets' in part funded by the DHF (grant-number: JTC2017-40-2017T096), H2020 'TO\_AITION', and Leducq Fondation [Plaq_Omics_](https://www.plaqomics.com/).
