abstract = "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular diseases. Despite tremendous progress in medicine, over 33 million individuals suffer from AF with a lifetime risk of ≈1 in 3 for individuals from European ancestry. The causes leading up to AF are myriad: environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors influence and modify the extent of disease.

So far, large-scale GWAS (genome-wide association studies) have identified over 100 genetic susceptibility loci for AF but fail to explain more than 6.4% of the heritability (which is estimated to be 22%). To improve the understanding of the biomolecular causes of AF, Wang et al had previously explored the contribution of the transcriptome and methylome (of whole blood) on risk of atrial fibrillation While these omics studies revealed more of the biological complexities in disease etiology, there is a limit in terms of increasing sample size, and alternative methodologies are required to dissect the root causes of diseases.

Technological advancements have made it possible to interrogate the human condition in sickness or in health at every level (A), but sharing of codes and methods, standardization of analytical approaches, and interoperability and uniformity of definitions will be key. High-throughput screening of putative causal genes at the cellular and model organism level and integration with data from human Mendelian diseases and traits are to be pursuit to discern disease relevant targets (B). Ultimately, this will yield innovative new drugs, clinical intervention regimes, and lifestyle changes (C).
